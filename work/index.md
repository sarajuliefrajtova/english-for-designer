### Request for a change
The company needed to change the structure of its obsolete and user-unfriendly website to one that would make the shopping process more pleasant for its clients.
</br>
### Sublimity, Simplicity & Respect
I designed all the pages with respect to the products — in the spirit of simplicity, nobility, but also luxury. My intetion was to let the products themselves stand out.
</br>
### What has it taught me?
1. Do not underestimate the valuation of the work, devote a whole day to it.
2. Determine in advance with the customer what your job really is, you can't do all.
3. If something is beyond the scope of your work, get paid for it.
4. Conduct honest communication with the customer.
5. Get some rest. Without rest, your work won't be worthwhile.
6. There is always room for improvement, but at some point we have to say "enough is enough".

### More than a game
‘Cognition’ is not just a game, but can also serve as a tool for psychotherapists in their offices. It includes two levels — the first level is designed especially for children 8+, the second is for 15+ (i.e. also for adults).
</br>
### Consultation with a specialist
Before implementing the actual visual style of the game, we conducted research and consulted with an expert in the field of psychology. By doing this, we obtained a lot of new insights into how to best design the game.
</br>
### Exploring & understanding emotions
In the first level (8+), the game begins with the child choosing a card with an illustration that embodies the emotion which had experienced. After a while of observation, the child tries to name that emotion (or vice versa).  Following that, there is a step of defing needs which are connected to that emotion and name them. This principle is applied to other card sets.   The process of defining emotions is not easy, so it is also suitable for adults.
