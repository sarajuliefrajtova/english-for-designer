## About

<!-- Consider including a headshot. We’re not designing, so keep the image width/height around 320px x 320px (square). Replace "surname" with your surname in the file name. -->

I believe understanding ourselves, our identity and our purpose is the fundamental matter of life. But also one of the most challenging one.
With the design development of any product or brand identity it is quite similar — and when we reach the end of this 'seeking' process, we have a gut feeling that this is 'it'. 

I believe that every single action, every single decision, leads us in an unpredictable journey. The only way to deal with this unpredictability is to let yourself go with the flow of life and accept and operate with what life offers you. 


## Featured Projects

Currently, I am mainly involved in a digital design (web, UX & UI design) and graphic design. Each project is slightly different as this is dependent on the individual needs of each client.  
/ Nowadays, I have also started to get more involved in other spheres of design, as well as art and self-expression in general. /

### Bonclé

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

- Compelete web and e-shop redesign for czech manufacturing brand Bonclé. 
- The company needed to change the structure of its obsolete and user-unfriendly website to one that would make the shopping process more pleasant for its clients. 
- The website and e-shop were completely redesigned — from the user-flow to the complex UI design. My intention was to design a website with a minimalistic and elegant visual style that would highlight the uniqueness of each leather handbag and its accessories. I had to deal with a number of fairly tough moments during this project, although as always it was so enriching all round.
