## About

<!-- Consider including a headshot. We’re not designing, so keep the image width/height around 320px x 320px (square). Replace "surname" with your surname in the file name. -->

#### Welcome — my name is Sara Julie.
I believe understanding ourselves, our identity and our purpose is the fundamental matter of life. But also one of the most challenging one.
With the design development of any product or brand identity it is quite similar — and when we reach the end of this 'seeking' process, we have a gut feeling that this is 'it'. 

I have a faith that every single action, every single decision, leads us in an unpredictable journey. The only way to deal with this unpredictability is to let yourself go with the flow of life and accept and operate with what life offers you. 


## Featured Projects

Currently, I am mainly involved in a digital design (web, UX & UI design) and graphic design. Each project is slightly different as this is dependent on the individual needs of each client.  
/ Nowadays, I have also started to get more involved in other spheres of design, as well as art and self-expression in general. /

### Bonclé

![Showcase of webpages design for Boncle company.](img/Showcase-of-webpages-design-for-Boncle-company.png)

- Compelete web and e-shop redesign for czech manufacturing brand Bonclé. 
- The company needed to change the structure of its obsolete and user-unfriendly website to one that would make the shopping process more pleasant for its clients. 
- The website and e-shop were completely redesigned — from the user-flow to the complex UI design. My intention was to design a website with a minimalistic and elegant visual style that would highlight the uniqueness of each leather handbag and its accessories. I had to deal with a number of fairly tough moments during this project, although as always it was so enriching all round.

### Cognition (Poznanie)

![The card game Cognition laid out on the table.](img/The-card-game-Cognition-laid-out-on-the-table.jpg)

- Communication card game _Cognition_ for the final work of the 2nd year of university studies.
- The task was to design / redesign pre-existing any kind of game which will carry its testimonial value.
- As a result we (my team and I) designed a psychological communication game that serves as an aid in finding words and exploring humans emotions. Prior to the actual implementation phase, we have conducted a search, including consultation with a psychologist. Within the visiual design we used color gradients, and element in the form of a wave. Both of these distinctive aspects carries its meaning:
    - Color gradient is a symbol of emotions that blend together in different ways and are often difficult to define. However, with the help of the game we can better define them and work with them.
    - The wave is a symbol of emotions and their development — the game should help people to alleviate highest and the most intense point of emotion.

### Rheumatism on chill (Revma v klidu)

![Showcase of selected screens of the application.](img/Showcase-of-selected-screens-of-the-application.png)

- Digital motivational and educational course for the people who are being treated for rheumatic diseases. The project is led by the non-profit organization [_Revma Liga ČR_](https://www.revmaliga.cz/) together with the volunteer organization [_Česko.Digital_](https://cesko.digital/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAmNeqBhD4ARIsADsYfTez5yT8aah8tkRU4_I1avEtFvOxrTf6ypQ401lAcjK25XlKTM48HhEaAqdtEALw_wcB) (_Czech.Digital_), which brings together volunteers, mainly from the IT field.
- The project aims to spread the awareness of the rheumatic diseases as well as changing the form of treatment for both rheumatics and the ageing population in general. It will help to initiate motivation to exercise at home even in people who do not have the opportunity to exercise with professional assistance for a long time.
- I've been contributing as junior UX designer, whereby I was leaded by senior UX designer. Thanks to this opportunity, I have gained a lot of new expriences — from user research (in-depth user interviews & etc.) to user testing, as well as working in an interprofessional team. Besides that, it has taught the importance of expressing my opinion about the addressed topic.

### Czech School Without Borders — London

![Showcase of selected screens of the application.](img/Showcase-of-visual-of-Czech-School-Without-Borders-In-London.png)

- Redesign of visual identity for Czech School Without Borders in London.
- The school needed to establish a complete visual identity of its own. One of the essential requirement was to categorize the school's activities through the on-line and off-line communication in a way that would be understandable to users (especially parents).
- With my colleague , we came up with a concept for their visual identity and solved the problem of categorizing activities. To categorize the activities, we defined a system of four pillars, where each pillar is assigned one symbol. The school was impressed by our concept and decided to continue working with us.
