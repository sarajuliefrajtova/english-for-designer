## About

<!-- Consider including a headshot. We’re not designing, so keep the image width/height around 320px x 320px (square). Replace "surname" with your surname in the file name. -->

I believe understanding ourselves, our identity and our purpose is the fundamental matter of life. But also one of the most challenging one.
With the design development of any product or brand identity it is quite similar — and when we reach the end of this 'seeking' process, we have a gut feeling that this is 'it'. 

I believe that every single action, every single decision, leads us in an unpredictable journey. The only way to deal with this unpredictability is to let yourself go with the flow of life and accept and operate with what life offers you. 


## Featured Projects

Currently, I am mainly involved in a digital design (web, UX & UI design) and graphic design. 
However, I'm open to discover other fields of design, as well as the art field — that I've come to appreciate, along with getting to know myself.

### Featured Project 1 Title

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

![Write an alternative text description.](img/featured-project-01.png)

- A short description about the project — *the what*.
- A short description about the significance of the project — *the whys*.
- A short description about the outcome of the project — *the result or takeaway*.

<!-- Use the same stucture above for the rest of your featured projects. -->
