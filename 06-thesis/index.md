## Abstract
The bachelor thesis deals with the realization of the design of a digital product, which is a mobile application for the Regional Gallery Liberec. The aim of the application is to optimize the existing digital services provided by this institution and thus increase interaction with visitors during their stay in the OGL and beyond. During the design process, emphasis was placed on creating the most user-friendly product possible. To achieve this goal, research was conducted, which included an in-depth interview. The most extensive part of the whole work is the design of the visual appearance of the application, i.e. the user interface (UI). To achieve a consistent UI, an extensive UI library was created using the Atomic design method. The UI library can be considered as input for the possible following implementation of the design system. The work also includes suggestions for the promotion of the application itself.

### Introduction

#### Welcome,
My name is Sara Julie.

For my bachelor thesis I chose to create a design and implementation of a visual interface for a mobile application for the Museum of Fine Arts Liberec.

One primary motivation behind selecting the mobile app option was a wish to delve into the creation of digital products of this nature. This became as the initial impulse the selection of the topic for this bachelor thesis.

I'd like to note that developing an app for the gallery wasn't initially the intended direction. Prior to settling on the gallery concept, I envisioned developing an app centered around self-discovery. That is, an app that would address self-knowledge on a deeper level and assist its users on their journey. Ultimately, owing to the expansive nature of the subject matter, I opted to proceed with design a gallery app.

During 2023, I was actively involved in the development of the application within the _[Česko.Digital](https://en.cesko.digital/)_ community. It is a volunteer organization that brings together volunteers mainly from the IT field who work on digital projects for non-profit organizations, state administration or local government. This community is aware of the problem of obsolescence in the field of digital technologies, which consequently negatively affects the whole society. The community aims to continuously improve this situation. This experience in Česko.Digital became one of the other, secondary impulses for the realization of the bachelor thesis.
