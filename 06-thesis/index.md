### Abstract
The bachelor thesis deals with the realization of the design of a digital product, which is a mobile application for the Regional Gallery Liberec. The aim of the application is to optimize the existing digital services provided by this institution and thus increase interaction with visitors during their stay in the OGL and beyond. During the design process, emphasis was placed on creating the most user-friendly product possible. To achieve this goal, research was conducted, which included an in-depth interview. The most extensive part of the whole work is the design of the visual appearance of the application, i.e. the user interface (UI). To achieve a consistent UI, an extensive UI library was created using the Atomic design method. The UI library can be considered as input for the possible following implementation of the design system. The work also includes suggestions for the promotion of the application itself. ![Uploading image.png…]()
