## Introduction
When I reflect on the question, “How would you evaluate your year?” two potential interpretations emerge:

1. I could interpret it as encompassing the entire calendar year, from January to December of 2023.
2. Alternatively, I could view it as a school term, spanning from October 2023 to June 2024.

Considering that option 1 also encompasses a period when school is not in session, it represents a significantly broader timeframe. Consequently, I have chosen this “option”

## In the School I've learned:
- The field of study we choose doesn't solely dictate our future. Like many other aspects of our lives, our chosen field of study encompasses more than just the knowledge and skills we acquire. It becomes an integral part of our life journey, influencing us in ways that extend far beyond what we perceive.
- Striving for perfection isn't necessary in everything we do. Instead, we aim to do our best, based on how we feel and what we're capable of at the time.
- Prioritizing perfection in all work we do at the expense of sleep is a method that ultimately undermines a significant portion of our health.
- Time-management is an essential.
- I never thought that English classes could be so enriching for my personal development. One of the realizations is that I'm not solely “Sara, a designer from Liberec.“ It's made me realize that the question “Who are we?“ can be perceived in ways different from our perception.
- Honest communication is essential in all aspects of life. If we feel unwell, communicate it. If we would like to approach something differently, communicate it etc.

## In the Professional Life I've Learned:
- Don't underestimate the valuation of the work, devote a whole day to it.
- Determine in advance with the customer what your job really is, you can't do all.
- If something is beyond the scope of your work, get paid for it.
- Get some rest. Without rest, your work won't be worthwhile
- There is always room for improvement, but at some point, we have to say “Enough is enough.“.
