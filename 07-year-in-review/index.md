## Introduction
When I reflect on the question, “How would you evaluate your year?” two potential interpretations emerge:

1. I could interpret it as encompassing the entire calendar year, from January to December of 2023.
2. Alternatively, I could view it as a school term, spanning from October 2023 to June 2024.

Considering that option 1 also encompasses a period when school is not in session, it represents a significantly broader timeframe. Consequently, I have chosen this “option”

## In the School I've learned:
- The field of study you choose doesn't solely dictate your future. Like many other aspects of your lives, your chosen field of study encompasses more than just the knowledge and skills you acquire. It becomes an integral part of your life journey, influencing us in ways that extend far beyond what we perceive.
- Striving for perfection isn't necessary in everything you do. Instead, you aim to do our best, based on how we feel and what you're capable of at the time.
- Prioritizing perfection in all work you do at the expense of sleep is a method that ultimately undermines a significant portion of your health.
- Time-management is an essential.
- I never thought that English classes could be so enriching for my personal development. One of the realizations is that I'm not solely “Sara, a designer from Liberec.“ It's made me realize that the question “Who are we?“ can be perceived in ways different from our perception.
- Honest communication is essential in all aspects of life. If you feel unwell, communicate it. If we would like to approach something differently, communicate it etc.

## In the Professional Life I've Learned:
- Don't underestimate the valuation of the work, devote a whole day to it.
- Determine in advance with the customer what your job really is, you can't do all.
- If something is beyond the scope of your work, get paid for it.
- Get some rest. Without rest, your work won't be worthwhile
- There is always room for improvement, but at some point, we have to say “Enough is enough.“.
- Don’t underestimate your personal value.
- Ask your colleagues for help/opinion whenever you need it. You areen’t competent to know everything. Don't be afraid to be the 'dumbest' in the room you're never actually dumb, it's just your ego that thinks you are.
- Explore new, less unpredictable journeys, the power of serendipity is marvellous
- Rejecting new, currently unfeasible (whether for financial or other reasons ideas means limiting your ability to develop. The future is unpredictible.
- You don't have to be perfect. Perfectionism is just a lack of authenticity.
- As a strongly detail-oriented person, set yourself a time frame in which you have to complete a certain goal and be happy with what you have created without constantly modifying it.
