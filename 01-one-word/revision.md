### A Hook
"OK"—a conversation killer or traditional digital-age reply?


### Thesis Statement
"OK" — is it a secret way of saying, “I'm excited, but I won’t admit it" or "I’m full of emotions, but I’ll act cool“?. Even so, the truth is much less impressive. "OK" just slams the door on any chance of having a real talk. 


### Whys And Supporting Points
#### 1. Why "OK" is a common and often frustrating response:
- Supporting point: “OK" has become prevalent, especially in our fast-paced world where people seek to minimize word count when replying. However, this prevalence can be frustrating because it often feels impersonal and empty.

#### 2. Why people might attempt to decode the hidden meaning of "OK":
- Supporting point: The reason for trying to decode the potential hidden meaning behind the word „OK" — such as whether it indicated excitement or suppressed emotions. This illustrates that people that people are often puzzled by the simplicity of this response. 

#### 3. Why "OK" can be a conversation killer:

#### 4. Why older generations might also use "OK" and the implications of this:
- Supporting point: As our parents (especially generation x) discover the digital world and its vocabulary (and especially the use of English words and acronyms as a standard). They also discovered the answer "OK" without knowing exactly the hidden problem of the word. 

#### 5. Why "OK" can make people feel like they haven’t said anything at all:
- Supporting point: By replying with “OK“, you can leave people feeling as if their meaningful contributions to a conversation have gone unnoticed or unappreciated. It makes individuals question the purpose of their communication and whether they were seeking a genuine reply.

#### 6. Why it’s acceptable to dislike the word "OK":
- Supporting point: It’s acceptable to have a negative opinion of the word "OK" due its often unfulfilling and unemotional nature in conversation.


### The Conclusion
So, there’s to "OK" – the two-letter word which can both confuse and frustrate us, all while making us feel like we didn't really say anything at all. Nonetheless, it’s "OK" to dislike it, right?

<del>Ah,</del> "OK" The two-letter responses — for those of ones who <del>haven’t ever heard about</del> this <mark>stunning</mark> word yet, poor you. <ins>Ah,</ins> Poor you, if you love to stand at the edge of blandness and confusion at the same time. 
“OK” — the two-letter response — for those who have yet heard of this stunning word. Ah, poor you, if you love to stand at the edge of blandness and confusion at the same time.

I have no clue where it all started, but perhaps it emerged in our fast-paced world, where many of us aim to minimise our word count when replying. As a result, we've decided to truncate phrases like "I'm fine" or "Well" to a simple "O K."

<del>Picture this:</del> you pour your heart out to someone, spilling your deepest feelings and thoughts onto the digital canvas. You hit send, eagerly awaiting a meaningful response. You see <del>3 waving dots </del><ins>three bouncing dots (•••) </ins>indicating that the one on the other side is writing <del>his</del> <ins>their</ins> report. After five minutes of anticipation <del>.
Y</del> <ins>, y</ins>ou receive, "OK". No exclamation point, no heartfelt emoji<del>, just "O K". It's like receiving a</del><ins>. Just an “OK” — a big</ins> warm hug from a robot.

At first, I tried to decode the hidden meaning behind this seemingly simple word. Was it a secret way of saying, "I'm excited, but I won’t admit it" or "I’m full of emotions, but I’ll act cool"? Even so, the truth is much less impressive. It<del>’s</del> <ins>was</ins> something like a shoulder shrug, a way of saying "Eh… whatever.". You can pour heart <del>into a conversation</del>, and "OK" just slams the door on any chance of having <del>a</del> <ins>any</ins> real <del>talk</del> <ins>conversation</ins>.

I've come to one realisation<del>. In a similar way as</del> <ins>that it’s connected with</ins> our parents <del>are</del> <ins>(Gen X, okay). Same as they are</ins> discovering beauty of <del>our</del> traditional social media <del>platforms such as Facebook, YouTube or even Instagram,</del><ins>(Facebook, Instagram, YouTube). And</ins> they’ve <del>also</del> discovered <del>charm</del> <ins>beauty</ins> of some words. <ins>Words</ins> that our generation <ins>may</ins> consider <del>as an anachronism</del> <ins>old-fashioned or outdated</ins>. 

Yes, I'm referring to the word "OK". My parents love to use this kind of biped <ins>(two-legged)</ins> word. My mum has even her own mesmerising combination <ins>, a real one-two punch</ins>: "OK" plus "thumbs up" emoji. I understand <ins>it</ins>, <del>they</del> <ins>she's</ins> <del>just</del> try<ins>ing</ins> to be <del>modern</del> <ins>cool</ins> and kind <del>as well</del> <ins>at the same time</ins>. But let's be honest, it's the ultimate conversation killer, <del>a linguistic underachiever (= someone who doesn’t perform as well/work as hard as he/she can)</del> <ins>an epic text fail</ins>. <ins>It’s a</ins> word that makes you question whether you ever asked for a reply in the first place.

So, there’s to "OK" – the two-letter word <ins>, phrase, and catch-all reply for everything.</ins> <del>which can both</del> <ins>To</ins> confuse and frustrate us, all while making us feel like we didn’t <ins>really</ins> say anything at all. <del>Nonetheless</del> <ins>Yet</ins>, it’s "OK" to dislike it, right? <ins>I mean — OK.</ins>
