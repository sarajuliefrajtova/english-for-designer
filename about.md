## My life attitude —

I have a faith that every single action, every single decision, leads us in an unpredictable journey. The only way to deal with this unpredictability is to let yourself go with the flow of life and accept and operate with what life offers you.

### Philosphy, Art, Spirit 

Philosophy has been a big and essential part of me since I was a kid. At that time, however, I did not read any intellectual literature, I have only constantly thought deeply about the world, about the purpose of our existence and observed everything around me. 

In the course of my life I gradually began to find the way to my true knowledge. On this journey, I have come to understand that art and spirituality are an essential part of it.  This is actually the very first time in my life that I am speaking about this publicly.

Now, I am applying these insights to my design projects. They serve as a source for me to understand or implement concepts, create beauty and nobility, and infuse a unique spirit into the brand or product.
