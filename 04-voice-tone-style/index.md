## Voice

### My voice is:

- **Respectful:** Whenever I talk with other people, I use a respectful voice. I listen properly, I'm present and calm as possible to understand other people on each and every level of their message and expression — and based on that I'm able to answer them without judging. I'm not taking other's perspective personally, rather I'm in position of independet, neutral viewer, so I'm able to respond without being in the throes of emotion. It doesn't mean I totally don't care about other's oppinion, I just realize that each of us see the external world based on the inner state. This leads to different perceptions of the ceratin identical situation. 
When needed, I'm able to hear others out.
- **Honest but Polite:** Even though, I'm respectful to other, I speak honestly, I don't lie. However, I use polite, inoffensive language. I belive honesty is absolutely fundamental part human's communication.

### But sometimes my voice is also:
- **People-pleasing:** In some cases, currently it's much less than before, I try to over-explain concerete situation to not hurt other people or to defend myself, so other won't thinking about me in a plain I wouldn’t like to. But I'm glad I've been changing this habit within how I'm exploring my _being_.

## Tone

- **Friendly:** When I meet new people, I tend to be more of a spectator and listener than a speaker. After some time of analyzing the people around me, when I feel safe, I become curious about them - through various questions I ask them about their personality and life. However, I respect their personal boundires and time. I try to observe their facial expressions, gestures and posturology to sense if the person feels comfortable during the communication.  In my circle of closest friends, with the level of familiarity I already have with them, I know what I can afford to do tell them, but not harm them in any way.
- **Kind and Direct:** In my 'professional' life – when speaking with clients, teachers, possibly in some official matters – I tend to use direct tone of voice to achieve consensus. I use clear, honest language, but always in assertive way to prevent any possible conflict. In case of need I'm able to explain the issue at hand again in detail to help the other person understand the topic / situation better.
