Malinna is one of the brands I could say "I identify with" (but not literaly — as with any kind of brand). I just enjoy its overall concept — from the products themselves, through the brand presentation to their communication with its costumers.

## Voice

Malinna voice is:

- **Gentle & Calming**: Mallina use gentle voice as their products are aimed mostly for woman and as the brand represents natural products.
- **Grounded & Non-Expressive**: Brand voice is grounded, in its it doesn’t use expressive words. It uses more plain but gentle composed sentences.
- **Professional & Caring**: Within the brand’s copy there is a feeling of professional product & service provider. 
- **Approachable**: When the brand provides more expert content, it tries to be as approachable as possible.

Examples: 
- **Example 1**: “Care does not end with the sale for us. We pay our clients individual attention. They are encouraged to consult with us or seek our advice especially if they use our products as supportive care in the treatment of their health conditions.”
- **Example 1**: “The essence. The product ingredients contain solely the highest quality raw organic oils, natural salts, essential oils and herbal infusions – their flowers, fruits, seeds, roots or the whole plants. Following the processing using no additional synthetic chemicals, the final compounds become soluble in water and fully absorbable. The natural origin of the constituents enables the organism to work with each of them effectively. It can utilise them directly and simultaneously use them to create other essential nutrients inevitable for its correct development, functioning and regeneration. The inhibiting properties of some constituents of all our products weaken the pathogens in the body and thus impede their replication. The attenuated pathogens become a library for the immune system developing resistance to them.”

## Tone
Based on my small content style “research” I’ve found out that:
- The brand voice is pretty consistent. Its voice is kept while changing a bit its tone based on the situation (such as the special offer — Valentine's Day / Products for kids etc.).
