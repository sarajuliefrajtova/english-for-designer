## Voice

### My voice is:

- **Respectful**: Whenever I talk with others, I use a respectful voice. I listen attentively, Iâ€™m as present and calm as possible to understand other people on every level of their message and expression. Based on that ,Iâ€™m able to answer them without judging. Iâ€™m not taking otherâ€™s perspectives personally. Rather Iâ€™m in a (or the) position of independent, neutral viewer, so Iâ€™m able to respond without being in the throes of emotion. It doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t care about otherâ€™s opinions, I realize that each of us sees the external world based on the inner state. This leads to different perceptions of certain identical situations. When needed, Iâ€™m able to hear others out.
- **Honest but Polite**: Even though, Iâ€™m respectful to others, I speak honestly, and I donâ€™t lie. But I use polite, inoffensive language. I believe honesty is an fundamental part of human communication.

### But sometimes my voice is also:
- **People-pleasing**: In some cases, currently itâ€™s much less than before, I strive to over-explain particular situations. In a reason to not hurt other people or to defend myself, so others wonâ€™t think about me in a way? I wouldnâ€™t like to. But Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™ve been changing this habit within how Iâ€™m exploring my _being_.

## Tone

- **Friendly**: When I meet new people, I tend to be more of a spectator and listener than a speaker. After some time of analyzing the people around me, when I feel safe, I become curious about them. Through various questions, I ask them about their personalities and life. But, I respect their boundaries and time. I try to observe their facial expressions, gestures, and posturology. To sense if the person feels comfortable during the communication. In my circle of closest friends, with the level of familiarity I already have with them, I know what I can afford to do tell them, but not harm them in any way.
- **Kind and Direct**: In my â€˜professionalâ€™ life â€“ when speaking with clients, teachers, and possibly in some official matters. I tend to use a direct tone of voice to achieve consensus. I use clear, honest language, but always in an assertive way to prevent any possible conflict. In case of need, Iâ€™m able to explain the issue at hand again in detail to help the other person understand topic/situation better.
- **Calm and Joyful**: Especially, among my family, I tend to be calm and using use quite specific language (I would call it the tone of our family ðŸ˜ƒ). I wouldnâ€™t use this language with any other people. In the circle of my family, I use is the most powerful words of in my vocabulary, as the relationship with my family the most important one for me. I tend to be quite humorous as we are used to a lot of funny-weird moments together.
- **Passionate and Serious**: In cases when I discuss a topic Iâ€™m deeply related to. Especially philosophy, psychology, art, and design, I use a passionate and sometimes pretty serious tone of voice. With a lot of question marks at the end of sentences.

## Style

- **Emojis**: I often use emojis in informal, sometimes in formal text as well. Tt depends on my relationship with the person on the other side communication. Yet, I donâ€™t overuse them. I take them as part of expressing some emotion, or use the them for better understanding the tone of a certain message.
- **Proper (Czech) grammar**: Since my elementary school studies Iâ€™ve been used to using proper grammar with all the trimmings. I use this â€˜ruleâ€˜ in most cases, except in situations that need fast answer or in a â€˜texting modeâ€™ with my friends/family. By using proper grammar, people create more comprehensible content. People can also prevent unnecessary confusion for the person on the other side of the line.
- **Sometimes brief, sometimes extensive**: I strive to write the text as brief as possible. Besides, in some cases (especially when Iâ€™m explaining more complex topics to a customer), I write more extensive reports. This is because I wish to help them understand the topic better.
- **Hierarchy**: Almost in every message (many times even in informal cases) I use proper text hierarchy, to make the report as much readable as possible.
- **No exclamation marks!!!**: I avoid using exclamation marks to its least. I use exclamation marks only to express my gratitude towards somebody â€” e.g. when someone gives me a helping hand or prepares a surprise for me.
