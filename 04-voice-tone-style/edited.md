## Voice

### My voice is:

- **Respectful**: Whenever I talk with <del>other people</del> **others**, I use a respectful voice. I listen <del>properly</del> **attentively**, Iâ€™m as present and calm as possible to understand other people on <del>each and</del> every level of their message and expression â€” and based on that Iâ€™m able to answer them without judging. Iâ€™m not taking otherâ€™s <del>perspective</del> **perspectives** personally, rather Iâ€™m in **a (or the)** position of <ins>independet</ins>, neutral viewer, so Iâ€™m able to respond without being in the throes of emotion. It doesnâ€™t mean I <del>totally</del> donâ€™t care about otherâ€™s <del>oppinion</del> **opinions**, I just realize that each of us <del>see</del> **sees** the external world based on the inner state. This leads to different perceptions of <del>the</del> <ins>ceratin</ins> identical <del>situation</del> **situations**.
When needed, Iâ€™m able to hear others out.
- **Honest but Polite**: Even though, Iâ€™m respectful to <del>other</del> **others**, I speak honestly, **and** I donâ€™t lie. <del>However</del>, **But** I use polite, inoffensive language. I <ins>belive</ins> honesty is an absolutely fundamental part <del>humanâ€™s</del> **of human** communication.

### But sometimes my voice is also:
- **People-pleasing**: In some cases, currently itâ€™s much less than before, I strive to over-explain <ins>concerete</ins> <del>situation</del> **situations** to not hurt other people or to defend myself, so <del>other</del> **others** wonâ€™t <del>thinking</del> **think** about me in a <del>plain</del> **way**? I wouldnâ€™t like to. But Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™ve been changing this habit within how Iâ€™m exploring my _being_.

## Tone

- **Friendly**: When I meet new people, I tend to be more of a spectator and listener than a speaker. After some time of analyzing the people around me, when I feel safe, I become curious about them â€” through various questions, I ask them about their <del>personality</del> **personalities** and life. However, I respect their <del>personal</del> <ins>boundires</ins> and time. I try to observe their facial expressions, gestures, and <ins>posturology<ins> to sense if the person feels comfortable during the communication. In my circle of closest friends, with the level of familiarity I already have with them, I know what I can afford to do tell them, but not harm them in any way.
- **Kind and Direct**: In my â€˜professionalâ€™ life â€“ when speaking with clients, teachers, and possibly in some official matters â€“ I tend to use a direct tone of voice to achieve consensus. I use clear, honest language, but always in an assertive way to prevent any possible conflict. In case of need, Iâ€™m able to explain the issue at hand again in detail to help the other person understand the <del>topic / situation</del> **topic/situation** better.
- **Calm and Joyful**: Especially among my family, I tend to be calm and using use quite specific language (I would call it the tone of our family ðŸ˜ƒ) which I wouldnâ€™t use with any other people. In the circle of my family, I use is the most powerful words of in my vocabulary, as the relationship with my family the most important one for me. I tend to be quite <ins>humoric</ins> **humorous** as we are used to <del>create</del> **creating** a lot of funny-weird moments together.
- **Passionate and Serious**: In cases when I discuss <del>about some</del> a topic Iâ€™m deeply related to â€” especially <ins>philoshphy</ins>, psychology, art, and design â€” I use a passionate and sometimes pretty serious tone of voice. With a lot of question marks at the end of sentences.

## Style

<!-- Consider including style tips on capitalization of headings (sentence or title case), words to avoid, or general grammar and mechanics dos and donâ€™ts, etc.
See: https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/grammar-and-mechanics/-->

- **Emojis**: I <del>usually</del> **often** use <âˆ‚el>emoji</del> **emojis** in informal (sometimes in formal text as well â€” it depends on my <ins>realtionship</ins> with the <del>human</del> **person** on the other side) communication. <del>Nonetheless</del> **Yet**, I donâ€™t <del>over use</del> **overuse** them. I take them as part of expressing some emotion, or use the them for better understanding the tone of <del>the</del> **a** certain message.
- **Proper (Czech) grammar**: Since my elementary school studies <del>Iâ€™m<del>, **Iâ€™ve been** used to <del>use</del> **using** proper <ins>grammatics</ins> **grammar** with all the trimmings. I use this â€˜ruleâ€˜ in most <del>of the</del> cases, except **in** situations <del>which are requiring</del> **that require** fast answer or in a â€˜texting modeâ€™ with my <del>friends / family</del> **friends/family**. By using proper grammar, people create more comprehensible content and can prevent unnecessary confusion for the person on the other side of the line.
- **Sometimes brief, sometimes extensive**: I strive to write the text as brief as possible. Nevertheless, in some cases (especially when Iâ€™m explaining more complex <del>topic</del> **topics** to a customer), I write more extensive reports. This is because I wish to help them understand the topic better.
- **Hierarchy**: Almost in every message (many times even in informal cases) I use proper text hierarchy, to make the report as much readable as possible.
- **No exclamation marks<del>!!!!</del>!!!**: I avoid using exclamation marks to its minimum. I use exclamation marks only to express my <ins>graditude</ins> towards somebody â€” e.g. when someone <del>provides</del> gives me a helping hand or <del>prepare</del> **prepares** a surprise for me.
