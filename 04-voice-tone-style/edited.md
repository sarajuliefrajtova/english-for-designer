## Voice

### My voice is:

- **Respectful**: Whenever I talk with other people others, I use a respectful voice. I listen properly attentively, I’m as present and calm as possible to understand other people on each and every level of their message and expression — and based on that I’m able to answer them without judging. I’m not taking other’s perspective perspectives personally, rather I’m in a (or the) position of independet, neutral viewer, so I’m able to respond without being in the throes of emotion. It doesn’t mean I totally don’t care about other’s oppinion opinions, I just realize that each of us see sees the external world based on the inner state. This leads to different perceptions of the ceratin identical situation situations.
When needed, I’m able to hear others out.
- **Honest but Polite**: Even though, I’m respectful to other others, I speak honestly, and I don’t lie. However, But I use polite, inoffensive language. I belive honesty is an absolutely fundamental part human’s of human communication.

### But sometimes my voice is also:
- **People-pleasing**: In some cases, currently it’s much less than before, I strive to over-explain concerete situation situations to not hurt other people or to defend myself, so other others won’t thinking think about me in a plain way? I wouldn’t like to. But I’m glad I’ve been changing this habit within how I’m exploring my being.

## Tone

- **Friendly**: When I meet new people, I tend to be more of a spectator and listener than a speaker. After some time of analyzing the people around me, when I feel safe, I become curious about them — through various questions, I ask them about their personality personalities and life. However, I respect their personal boundires and time. I try to observe their facial expressions, gestures, and posturology to sense if the person feels comfortable during the communication. In my circle of closest friends, with the level of familiarity I already have with them, I know what I can afford to do tell them, but not harm them in any way.
- **Kind and Direct**: In my ‘professional’ life – when speaking with clients, teachers, and possibly in some official matters – I tend to use a direct tone of voice to achieve consensus. I use clear, honest language, but always in an assertive way to prevent any possible conflict. In case of need, I’m able to explain the issue at hand again in detail to help the other person understand the topic / situation topic/situation better.
Calm and Joyful: Especially among my family, I tend to be calm and using use quite specific language (I would call it the tone of our family 😃) which I wouldn’t use with any other people. In the circle of my family, I use is the most powerful words of in my vocabulary, as the relationship with my family the most important one for me. I tend to be quite humoric humorous as we are used to create creating a lot of funny-weird moments together.
Passionate and Serious: In cases when I discuss about some a topic I’m deeply related to — especially philoshphy, psychology, art, and design — I use a passionate and sometimes pretty serious tone of voice. With a lot of question marks at the end of sentences.

## Style

<!-- Consider including style tips on capitalization of headings (sentence or title case), words to avoid, or general grammar and mechanics dos and don’ts, etc.

- **Emojis:** I usually use emoji in informal (sometimes in formal text as well — it depends on my realtionship with the human on the other side) communication. Nonetheless, I don't over use them. I take them as part of expressing some emotion, or use the for better understanding the tone of the certain message. 
- **Proper (Czech) grammar:** Since my elementary school studies I'm used to use proper grammatics with all the trimmings. I use this ‘rule‘  in most of the cases, except situations which are requiring fast answer or in a 'texting mode' with my friends / family. By using proper grammar, people create more comprehensible content and can prevent unnecessary confusion for the person on the other side of the line. 
- **Sometimes brief, sometimes extensive:** I strive to write the text as brief as possible. Nevertheless, in some cases (especially when I'm explaining more complex topic to a customer), I write more extensive reports. This is because I wish to help them understand the topic better.
- **Hierarchy:** Almost in every message (many times even in informal cases) I use proper text hierarchy, to make the report as much readable as possible. 
- **No exclamation marks!!!:** I avoid using exclamation marks to its minimum. I use exclamation marks only to express my graditude towards somebody — e.g. when someone provides me a helping hand or prepare a surprise for me.
