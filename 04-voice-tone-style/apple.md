I chose the Apple brand not because I identify with it. Although I like using their products. I chose this brand as an example of a powerful consistent brand voice.

## Voice

Apple voice is:

- Confident; 
- Making frequent use of short sentences and bold statements (which corresponds with the design of their products) — these make the company appear assured without being arrogant;
- The brand is voice is also straightforward:
  - It’s copy is easy to understand, even when it describes the more technical elements of its products.
  - This ensures its website content and marketing materials are easy for a large audience to understand. 
  - This helps Apple appeal to as wide an audience as possible rather than seeming exclusive or exclusionary (which could be a risk with products perceived as premium or luxury items).
- Apple’s brand voice remains consistent — even on its product pages and in product description
  - Not only in marketing content and social media posts
  - Apple has a strong brand voice because it flows through everything that company publishes

## Tone
Tone is always based on the Apple’s voice — short sentence, bold statements, easy to understand, straightforward. But its tone depends on the particular audience (students, parents, older, younger etc.) or on the situation (such as Valentine's day / Releasing new product / Student sales etc.). 
See examples below.
