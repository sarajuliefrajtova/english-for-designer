## Choosing a topic
From the very beginning I was convinced that I wanted to communicate something what has been deeply rooted within myself for a long time.
But because it's not just rooted in the mind, it's much further down, it only came to the surface when I gave it space. However, many times it has been drowned out by the voice of the mind, by the thousands of thoughts that have eclipsed it.


## First ideas & topic connections
- Full responsibility for each and every action
- Inner power
- Flow
- Creator
- Victim
- Blaming others
- Excuses
- Running away
- Hiding
- Hermit
- Before you try to save others, have you saved yourself? Or are you just hiding your problems behind others? Because you are not strong enough to stand up for yourself?
- Fear
- Mind vs Intution: Loud vs Quite
- Childhood
- Dance
- Flow of the sound, accept what the next sound brings and based on that creat the movement
