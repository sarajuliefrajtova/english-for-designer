## Choosing a topic
From the very beginning I was convinced that I wanted to communicate something what has been deeply rooted within myself for a long time.
But because it's not just rooted in the mind, it's much further down, it only came to the surface when I gave it space. However, many times it has been drowned out by the voice of the mind, by the thousands of thoughts that have eclipsed it. When I let the life flow, which mean when I accept what ever comes to. Only then could I begin to perceive the alignment. I don't know exactly when I get to that state. But I have found that the only thing that prevents me from being in this state all the time is my mind.

- Fear
- Mind vs Intution: Loud vs Quite
- Childhood
- Dance
- Flow of the music, accept what the next sound brings and based on that creat the movement; do what your body feels without caring what other people says, because if you do so, you become a victim — you gonna say _if they aren't there I would dance the way I feel._ No, you can dance the way you feel even if other people are there. Your fear putting you into the position of victim of being unable to express yourself fully, becuase you're still depended on others oppinion, on your mind loud voice, instead listening your inner calm voice.
