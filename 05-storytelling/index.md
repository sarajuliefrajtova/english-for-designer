### Welcome,
my name is Sara Julie. 

Let me tell you the story of the realisation. A realisation that brought about indescribable states in _Being_. States that appear and can disappear in an instant. States that make me feel calm as well as powerful. States in which I receive, flow and create. But it's a process, I may be at the very beginning of this journey. I'm still learning, still changing. However, I believe that these states don't have to be repetitive and temporary. These states can be a part of you. In the moment, when you choose. The moment you accept life as it is and start creating. I have faith that any change begins with becoming aware when it comes to this matter, followed by making a decision. But most importantly, taking the action.

_Maybe this story will open another imaginary door for some of you._

**Insert here a rhetorical question for the audience**

**Delete or edit somehow?: Music and dance. Since my childhood both them have been an indispensable part of my life. I have**

Music. The feeling of an invisible and indescribable energy passing through your whole body, a gentle ‘guide’. A guide that accompanies you with every note of the music, shaping your body into a different position with every hundredth note.

If you let the music flow, you do not evaluate it in any way, it permeates through your ears and into your mind. There it dissolves any thought. It passes on into your whole body. You don't have to know the music, you don't have to know the coming note. If you are fully aware of the tone at the moment, the music will guide you. It becomes your imaginary fellow dancer. But at the same time you become the creator. The creator of every movement of your body. A movement that is in complete synergy with the rhythm of the music. 

Music is a symbol of life, the flow of life, which, like the tone of unknown music, is unpredictable. The invisible guide is your intuition, which if you listen to, don't resist, you accept the flow of life (music). And the dance? That is the very decision, the actions flow with the music. That is, with life.

But if your mind steps into that role. That strong voice. The voice that controls your every decision. Rethinking the past and the future. But not capable of being in the present. The mind is like an object inside us. An object setting boundaries in infinite space. A space that is part of each of us. If we give full permission to this voice, we become its victim. We fall victim to everything that this voice carries, including all fears. Fears to create. To create every movement of the dance. We are afraid to accept the sequence of events. Life itself. Our movements contradict the music. They are influenced by fear. We are controlled by this object. We abandon ourselves. We repress our intuition at the expense of our fear of manifesting in the flow of life. The uncontrolled mind is dependent on external events to shape it. The mind needs external approval - the assessments and opinion of others. If it becomes dominant within us we lose control, afraid to manifest. We are paralyzed.
