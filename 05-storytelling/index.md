### Welcome,
my name is Sara Julie. Let me tell you the story of the realization. A realization that brought about indescribable states in my being. States that appear and can disappear in an instant. States that make me feel calm, but also strong. States in which I receive, flow and create. But it's a process, I may be at the very beginning of this journey. I'm still learning, still changing. But I believe that these states do not have to be repetitive and temporary. These states can be a part of you. In the moment, when you choose. The moment you accept life as it is and start creating. I have faith that any change begins with becoming aware when it comes to this matter, followed by making a decision, but most importantly, taking the action.
