### Welcome,
my name is Sara Julie. 

Let me tell you the story of the realisation. A realisation that brought about indescribable states in _Being_. States that appear and can disappear in an instant. States that make me feel calm as well as powerful. States in which I receive, flow and create. But it's a process, I may be at the very beginning of this journey. I'm still learning, still changing. However, I believe that these states don't have to be repetitive and temporary. These states can be a part of you. In the moment, when you choose. The moment you accept life as it is and start creating. I have faith that any change begins with becoming aware when it comes to this matter, followed by making a decision. But most importantly, taking the action.

_Maybe this story will open another imaginary door for some of you._

#### Music.
Feeling. The feeling of an invisible and indescribable energy. An energy passing through your whole body, a gentle ‘guide’. A guide that accompanies you with every note of the music, shaping your body into a different position. With every hundredth of a second.

If you let the music flow. If you don't evaluate it in any way, it permeates through your ears and into your mind. There it dissolves any thought. It passes on into your whole body. You don't have to know the music, you don't have to know the coming note. If you are fully aware of the tone at the moment, the music will guide you. It becomes your imaginary fellow dancer. But at the same time you become the creator. The creator of every movement of your body. A movement that is in complete synergy with the rhythm of the music. 

Music is a symbol of life, the flow of life, which, like the tone of unknown music, is unpredictable. The invisible guide is your intuition. Intuition, that when you listen to, you don't resist, you accept the flow of life — the music. And the dance? That is the very decision, the actions flow with the music. That is, with life.

But if your mind steps into that role. That strong voice. The voice that controls your every decision. Rethinking the past and the future. But not capable of being in the present. The mind is like an object inside us. An object setting boundaries in infinite space. A space that is part of each of us. If we give full permission to this voice, we become its victim. We fall victim to everything that this voice carries, including all fears. Fears to _create_. To create every movement of the _dance_. We are afraid to accept the sequence of events. Life itself. Our movements contradict the music. They are influenced by fear. We are controlled by this object. We abandon ourselves. We repress our intuition at the expense of our fear of manifesting in the flow of life.

The uncontrolled mind is dependent on external events to shape it. The mind needs external approval — the assessments and opinion of others. If it becomes dominant within us. If it oversteps its field of influence, we lose control. We're afraid to express ourselves. We are paralyzed. 

#### First Encounter.
Music and dance have always been an essential part of my life. My first touch with music and dance, probably like most of us, was at an early age. One of the first dances that remained in my mind was when I was 2 years old. (I believe this moment may have been influenced to some extent by the narrative of my parents). However, I do recall certain memorable fragments.
It was quite late night at New Year's celebration. My parents and their friends were calmly enjoying their talk. In the background there was playing a song — Stayn' Alive by Bee Gees. From my calm sit, I suddenly become alive. I tuned into that music. I have started to move my body. Somehow. I didn't know the music. I didn't know the steps either. I have just let my body and mind flow with the tone. I didn't care whether the movements were ridiculous for others. I wasn't scared. I wasn't nervous. I didn't feel awkward, at all. I just was. _Creating_ my own moment. I had that internal power inside of me.

#### Separtion.
My parents always encouraged me to be involved in sports. One of them was gymnastic aerobics. Aerobics was actually the first sport I did at a competitive level. I devoted myself to it from the age of 5 to 8. For those who have never encountered this sport before. Gymnastic aerobics competes individually or in a group. The aim of the performance is to deliver a competitive routine to the accompaniment of music. The competition routine requires static and dynamic strength, agility and proper coordination. 

I had faith that here I would be able to fuse music with movement. 

It was different than I imagined, though.

I lost the freedom of movement. I had to follow exactly what I was told. If didn't, I failed. I was sidelined. With every practice I lost my excitement. The initial enthusiasm for connecting with music through the body has faded. 

Before every practice, my body was writhed with fear. Intense cramps went through my stomach. With each arrival home from practice, I finally felt relief. My body was giving me a distinct clue. I had lied to my parents. I was unable to honestly convey my wishes. The wish to quit this sport. I was too young. I didn't want to disappoint. 

I wished to dance with the music according to my own feelings. Free. To create in the moment. I wasn't able to learn the steps by heart, according to my coach, I couldn't. 

At last, the day of relief has come — the end of aerobics. But also. The day of losing self-confidence. A day of losing faith that I'm competent to do what I enjoy most. The coach said to my mom, “_Sara can't hear the music._”.

When my mom told me the news, it affected me profoundly. Mom also shared with me her reaction — she knew I could hear the music.


#### Let Others Decide For Me.
So I left the world of aerobics for good. I tried other sports. Eventually, though, my path led me to competitive swimming. Where I stayed for the next 11 years. I have learned a lot. I've changed a lot. During this period of my life.

I met precious friends with whom I still have strong relationships. Here, however, my nature showed itself. The nature of self-distrust. I thought it would be better to let others decide for me. I believed it was the only way others would accept me. I was afraid to fully express myself. Even though none of my friends would judge me. I was a victim of my own fear. A fear that was rooted in my past experiences. 

At the time, I wasn't aware of these wounds from the past. A friend of mine once told me: “_You always make decisions based on others. You don't have a mind of your own._”. I felt betrayed back then. But she was correct. I had lost the ability to fully express my being. I lost that inner power. That voice, that light which everyone carries within them. 


#### Perfect.
Time passed. High school has arrived on the scene. All my fears hit me even harder. My mind became my worst enemy. To suppress my needs, I became a perfectionist. In all areas of life — school, home, sports etc. In my mind above all. By being _perfect_, I believed I would be successful. But I didn't realize one simple equation. I was doing it at the expense of my health — mental and physical. I was doing none of this for myself, but for others. To prove that I was capable. To prove what? That I'm capable of hurting myself? That I am capable of not being an authentic version of myself? That I'm capable of avoiding my life's desires? That I'm not responsible for my own life? 

I let my fears take over.

My mind, my body was shroud in an opaque fabric. With all the joy and desires hidden behind the curtain. 


#### Discovery.
I graduated from high school and moved on. I continued to do what life had offered me. What about my previous fears? A lot of them disappeared. Or maybe not quite. Maybe they were just hiding under a skinny blanket.

After 4 years of studying in field IT, in high school, I wanted a change. A change that would lead me closer to what fulfills me. Not just follow the loud voice of the mind.

Ever since I was a little girl, besides dancing, I also loved design. Designing all sorts of things. But mostly, interiors and clothes. 
Don't get it on some pro level. I just took a tablet. I downloaded some 3D interior design app. And the clock was ticking — 1 hour, 2, 3... I could have spent all day on it. Well, there was another way to create. Video games. And one of them was The Sims 3 & 4. A game I bought just to design houses. But of course, there were plenty of other games. Digital spaces where I could live out my desire to create. It was my daily joy.

Thanks to my friends I made a decision. Decision to study this college. Deep deep down I knew, I should chose this path. There was that tiny little voice. That little guide which didn’t push me anywhere. Just gently suggesting the steps. The steps I should take. But, I was under the influence of my fears. Again. 

I posed questions like: “_What if it doesn't live up to my expectations?“, “What if I don’t do it for a living?”, “What if…_”.

Finally, one of my friends spoke to me. She told me the words. Those words led me to my final decision.

First year of my studies. I put a little bit more on my plate. Way more. But, _somehow_ I was able to carry its weight. 

How?

By letting things _flow_. 

Laziness? No. Not at all.

I did the best I could. Always. 

This doesn't imply acting to the of point exhaustion.

It means to _be_.

To be in harmony with the music. With life. Shape every movement. The movement of the dance. The dance of the _now_. 

If we experience the music. _Clearly_. If we are awake. We are able to let the music pervade. Pervade through the body. Let each and every note of the music pervade. To be a musical instrument. An instrument that is tuned to the rhythm of life. An instrument that is in the hands of life. An instrument that is like a conductor. A substance through which the current of life flows. Through which every atom in space goes.

Infinite space. The substance. Space itself. 

But we can cross the border. That imaginary border. The war front. The line where they touch. The two of them. Seemingly inseparable. _Us_ and the mind. _Being_ and mind. Consciousness. And the _Mind_.
